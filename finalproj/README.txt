README

- Taylor Albus tma30 and Cameron King ck198.

- We started the assignment April 16th, finished completely April 30th, and spent a little under 100 hours on it

- We have discussed this assignment with no other students.

- We consulted the Vue and Firebase documentation and example code from class heavily.

- The image of Cameron on the home screen is his own property and the user uploaded images are their own.

- For bugs: the like button makes the entire list of posts refresh and get unsorted until refresh, but nothing huge.

- No extra credit features.



- WHAT MAKES YOUR APPLICATION USEFUL:
	- It can be hard to find a good hair stylist when you're new to town or just need a new place to go. This app helps users with that problem.
- SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS:
	- No special instructions are needed, but the admin email and password is:
		- admin@admin.com
		- adminadmin
- REFERENCES FOR YOUR DATA THAT ESTABLISHES ITS AUTHENTICITY:
	- We used Google Maps API to pull in autocompleted places and place markers on a map
- CHOSEN FRAMEWORKS
	- We decided to stick with Vue because we were familiar with it and believed that it would do everything that we needed it to do. We had considered React but realized that that would be too much of a burden.
	- We used Firebase to store the data because we were already familiar with it and it accomplished what we needed.
	- We used the Google Maps API to get autocomplete data for the barber shops and salons. We considered Yelp but it proved to be too complicated and too much of a hassle compared to what Google Maps offered.
