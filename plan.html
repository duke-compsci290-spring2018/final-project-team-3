				<h1>Final Topic</h1>
        		<h2>Problem</h2>
        		<p>When you’re out of town or new to town, it’s hard to find a good, reliable barber/hair stylist. College students have to search through Google Maps and Yelp to get ratings, price, and locations - and even then you don’t know if those people have similar preferences as you do. </p>
				<h2>Solution</h2>
        		<p>A web application that pools all barbers/hair stylists in an area and shows them on a map for convenience. The user can see the cost, set up an appointment, and get directions. There would be an option open up the location in maps or Uber/Lyft to the barbershop. Ratings would be crowdsourced, and people can upload photos of their cuts from that location - and an Instagram-type feed with photos and links to the barbers. Ratings could be sorted by distance, price, or based on the profiles of the reviewers, like their age. There would be a dashboard for the user (with login) to see their appointment time, past barbers, and transaction history.</p>
